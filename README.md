## About
**WeatherSynchronizer** is a lightweight plugin for
[Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) that synchronizes in-game weather
with real-world weather conditions limited to those in the game world, for
example the plugin cannot set drizzle as the current weather if the game
engine does not support such weather.
